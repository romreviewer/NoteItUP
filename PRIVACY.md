## Introduction

Welcome to NoteItUP. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our personal diary application ("App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a secure experience.

**TL;DR:** Your diary is private. We don't collect, read, or share your personal diary entries. Everything stays on your device unless you choose to use cloud backup.

- **Location Data**: GPS coordinates and addresses (only if you enable location tagging)
- **Tags and Folders**: Organizational data you create
- **App Settings**: Your preferences for themes, colors, and app behavior

**Important**: All this data is stored locally on your device. We do NOT have access to it.

### 2. Technical Information
- **Crash Reports**: Anonymous crash logs via Firebase Crashlytics to help us fix bugs
- **Analytics**: Anonymous usage statistics via Firebase Analytics (e.g., which features are used, not what you write)
